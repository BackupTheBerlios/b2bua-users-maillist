Subject: [B2bua-users] opensource prepaid system
Message-ID: <4791684D.3020004@tbgi.net.ph>

Hi,

Has anyone able to use a opensource prepaid system that integrates with 
ser/freeradius/*b2bua/asterisk?

I want to setup something based from opensource for now as i want to see 
how it works first to understand more of it. TIA

regards

Nhadie
