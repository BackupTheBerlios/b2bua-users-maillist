Hello manjula,

 Sorry for late answer.
 I have a FastAGI version of the scripts in development that
eliminate the problem with perl. On average specs machine I were able
to reach really high performance, so agi scripts not a bottleneck
anymore.
 On dual core machine with 2g ram > 500 concurent calls.
 The code working in production but I have not enough time to release
a patches for newest asterisk versions.
 But if you really need that I will check what can be done

Hello manjula,

 Yes, the code organization is the same but because the code will be
persistent in the memory you should carefully handle existence of all
objects, eg. database connection handling etc.
