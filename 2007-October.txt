Hello All,
I am new to this group
just before this i was working with only openser and radius
now i moved to  prepaid billing application for that my setup follows like

Asterisk B2BUA-0.3.0b patch installed on asterisk 1.4.2

Case 1:

When i tried to send request to radius as i used to did with openser
ie radcheck values

                             username User-Password pwd
it is showing it didnt find any corresponding values to the Digest method in
the request
and sent Access-Reject Reply

Case 2:

when i tried to remove the Auth-Type it showing it was not found any
auth-Type and
sending Access-Reject reply

Mike's B2BUA don't actually do the authentication (eg. You want to
authenticate users based on username/password). It use RAD auth just to
check the "session-time" value returned from RADIUS server.

 

So in the RADIUS Server, the clause should looks like this

 

<Realm DEFAULT>

        RewriteUsername s/^([^@]+).*/$1/

        <AuthBy SQL>

                DBSource dbi:mysql:dbname

                DBUsername sqlusername

                DBAuth sqlpassword

            

                AuthSelect select sessiontime(%0,
'%{cisco-h323-Dialed-Number}');

                AuthColumnDef   0,Session-Timeout,reply

</Realm>

 

Where sessiontime is a user created SQL database stored function, which
return the amount of seconds the user is allowed to make call to this
destination.

Hello srinivas,

 There is no digest autorization in B2BUA just because the user agent
 should be autorized by proxy (SER), the B2BUA is acting as called
 party (same like: called phone don't try to authorize the callee).
 You need to assume the call is autorized by a proxy and modify your
 radius billing logic.

Hello Mike,
Thank you very much for your valuable reply.

Actually my working setup was like this

1)openser doing authentication
2)asterisk+b2bua for call controlling using radius

I made the following implementations to make it work

in radreply table i added the following 2 attributes against the
Called party.
                   Session-Timeout=some fixed no of seconds
                  Acct-Interim-Update=60(default min provided by freeradius)

So using the Session-Timeout value returned from the  radius  asterisk
allowing
him to call for that many maximum seconds and if the limit exceeds it
terminates
the call

my question is:

There is no backward reflection in the Session-Timeout value in the radius
table
so that when a new call is made by this same called party the old hardcoded
value
it is using .

Is there any way i can decrement this Session-Timeout value as
     updated Session-Timeout value =(Previous Session-Timeout) -(Last call
billable seconds)

some of my friend giving advice to go ahead with CDRTool
does this helpful for my above requirements?

Kindly reply back

Thanks in advance

Hi All,

Would just like to inquire versions are working for you guys:

I tried asterisk 1.2.4 and asterisk b2bua version asterisk-b2bua-0.2.0b2

but when i patched asterisk with the patch in b2bua i get these errors:

i also tried asterisk-b2bua-0.3.0b but i also had error when patching

Hello srinivas,

 Sorry for delayed answer.
 *B2BUA sends authorization request and than Accounting-Start and
 Accounting-Stop, this usually is enough to do accurate billing.
 
 Asterisk don't maintain call state if there is no media passing over
 asterisk and the gateways crashed (or Internet uplink problems),
 alternatively you can setup rtp timeout, but then you will need to
 proxy all media.

 Acct-Interim-Update is used to initiate sending accounting updates,
 it mainly used to be sure that asterisk is running and not crashed. It
 don't maintain call state (i.e. it won't increase session-time when
 call is connected) due to asterisk architecture.
 So probably you can send Access request without Acct-Interim-Update
 attribute. 
 Due to radius protocol limitation YOU CANNOT send any reply with
 accounting reply packet, so you cannot update Session-Timeout from
 accounting packets.

Hello srinivas,

 I've never used CDRTool for billing purposes.
 As I know CDRTool is just analyzer of data provided from SER
 Mediaproxy module, also you can analyze that data yourself.
 Mediaproxy doing "call cutoff" in a bit wrong way - it just stop
 forwarding RTP data between instead of sending BYE,
 so user should hangup himself because no sound, maybe it will
 change if mediaproxy will start using ser dialog module,

 I use *B2BUA because it's much more flexible and I have some
